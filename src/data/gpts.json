Go to API Keys section\n4. Create a new secret key\n\n## Step 2: Clone and Setup ASU Local Wrapper\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/danielennis11111/rate-limiter\ncd rate-limiter\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure Multiple Providers\n\nCreate your environment configuration:\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env.multi-provider\n```\n\nEdit `.env.multi-provider`:\n\n```env\n# API Keys\nGEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here\n\n# Rate Limiting (per provider)\nRATE_LIMIT_GEMINI=15\nRATE_LIMIT_ANTHROPIC=10\nRATE_LIMIT_OPENAI=20\n\n# Default Provider\nDEFAULT_PROVIDER=gemini\n\n# Failover Configuration\nENABLE_FAILOVER=true\nFAILOVER_ORDER=gemini,anthropic,openai\n\n# Server Configuration\nPORT=3000\nENVIRONMENT=development\n```\n\n## Step 4: Update Model Configuration\n\nEdit `src/config/multi-models.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst providers = {\n  gemini: {\n    name: 'Google Gemini',\n    provider: 'google',\n    models: {\n      'gemini-1.5-pro': {\n        apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,\n        maxTokens: 8192,\n        temperature: 0.7,\n        supportedFeatures: ['text', 'image', 'multimodal']\n      }\n    },\n    rateLimit: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_GEMINI || 15\n  },\n  \n  anthropic: {\n    name: 'Anthropic Claude',\n    provider: 'anthropic',\n    models: {\n      'claude-3-sonnet': {\n        apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,\n        maxTokens: 4096,\n        temperature: 0.7,\n        supportedFeatures: ['text', 'analysis', 'reasoning']\n      }\n    },\n    rateLimit: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_ANTHROPIC || 10\n  },\n  \n  openai: {\n    name: 'OpenAI GPT',\n    provider: 'openai',\n    models: {\n      'gpt-4-turbo': {\n        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n        maxTokens: 4096,\n        temperature: 0.8,\n        supportedFeatures: ['text', 'conversation', 'creativity']\n      }\n    },\n    rateLimit: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_OPENAI || 20\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Step 5: Advanced Template Configuration\n\nCreate specialized templates for each provider in `src/data/multi-templates.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst templates = [\n  {\n    id: 'analysis-claude',\n    name: 'Deep Analysis (Claude)',\n    provider: 'anthropic',\n    model: 'claude-3-sonnet',\n    description: 'Use Claude for detailed analysis and reasoning tasks',\n    systemPrompt: 'You are Claude, an AI assistant specialized in thorough analysis...'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'creative-gpt',\n    name: 'Creative Writing (GPT)',\n    provider: 'openai', \n    model: 'gpt-4-turbo',\n    description: 'Use GPT-4 for creative and conversational tasks',\n    systemPrompt: 'You are a creative AI assistant specialized in storytelling...'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'multimodal-gemini',\n    name: 'Multimodal Assistant (Gemini)',\n    provider: 'gemini',\n    model: 'gemini-1.5-pro',\n    description: 'Use Gemini for text, image, and multimodal tasks',\n    systemPrompt: 'You are Gemini, a multimodal AI assistant...'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'intelligent-router',\n    name: 'Smart Router (All Providers)',\n    provider: 'auto',\n    description: 'Automatically choose the best AI for each task',\n    systemPrompt: 'Route queries to the most appropriate AI provider based on task type'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n## Step 6: Start Your Multi-Provider Chatbot\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev:multi-provider\n```\n\n## Step 7: Test Each Provider\n\n1. **Test Gemini**: \"Analyze this image and tell me what you see\"\n2. **Test Claude**: \"Provide a detailed analysis of climate change impacts\"\n3. **Test GPT**: \"Write a creative story about AI and humans\"\n4. **Test Auto-Router**: \"Help me plan a vacation\" (automatically routes to best provider)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Intelligent Provider Routing\nThe system automatically chooses the best AI based on:\n- **Images/Files**: Routes to Gemini (multimodal)\n- **Analysis Tasks**: Routes to Claude (reasoning)\n- **Creative Tasks**: Routes to GPT (creativity)\n- **General Questions**: Uses default or load balances\n\n### Failover Protection\nIf one provider fails:\n1. System automatically tries next provider in failover order\n2. User receives seamless experience\n3. Errors are logged for monitoring\n\n### Usage Analytics\nMonitor usage across providers:\n```bash\nnpm run analytics:providers\n```\n\n### Cost Optimization\nConfigure cost-based routing:\n```javascript\nconst costOptimization = {\n  gemini: { costPerToken: 0.00001 },\n  anthropic: { costPerToken: 0.00003 },\n  openai: { costPerToken: 0.00002 }\n};\n```\n\n## Production Deployment\n\n1. **Environment Setup**:\n```bash\ncp .env.multi-provider .env.production\n# Update with production API keys\n```\n\n2. **Security Configuration**:\n- Use environment-specific API keys\n- Set up SSL certificates\n- Configure firewall rules\n- Enable request logging\n\n3. **Monitoring**:\n- Set up provider health checks\n- Configure alerting for failures\n- Monitor API usage and costs\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Provider-Specific Issues:**\n- Verify each API key separately\n- Check rate limits for each provider\n- Test network connectivity to each service\n\n**Routing Issues:**\n- Check template configuration\n- Verify provider availability\n- Review failover logs\n\n**Performance Issues:**\n- Monitor response times per provider\n- Adjust rate limits as needed\n- Consider geographic API endpoints\n\n## Cost Management\n\n- **Free Tiers**: All providers offer generous free tiers\n- **Usage Monitoring**: Built-in usage tracking per provider\n- **Cost Alerts**: Set up billing alerts for each service\n- **Smart Routing**: Automatically route to most cost-effective provider\n\nWith this setup, you'll have a robust, multi-provider AI chatbot that leverages the strengths of each platform while providing seamless failover and intelligent routing!",
